Big quake rattles area of 20 million people in California; no one killed

A powerful earthquake jolted Southern California on Thursday, touching off fires, damaging buildings and forcing the evacuation of a hospital in a desert town northeast of Los Angeles, but there were only minor injuries.

The 6.4 magnitude quake, the most powerful in Southern California in 25 years, struck about 113 miles (182 km) northeast of Los Angeles near the city of Ridgecrest at around 10:30 a.m. PDT (1730 GMT), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The epicenter was on the edge of Death Valley National Park.

The Kern County Fire Department said it was dealing with “multiple injuries” that it described as minor, two house fires, small brush fires and gas leaks.

California Governor Gavin Newsom approved an emergency proclamation, and Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden said she had declared a state of emergency, a step that enables the town to receive help from outside agencies.

Ridgecrest Regional Hospital was being evacuated and patients were being moved to other locations for fear of a powerful aftershock, she said. About 15 patients were moved, local media said, citing fire officials.

Although no injuries had been reported, Breeden said she has asked residents to check on their neighbors in the high desert town, which has a population of about 28,000.

“We’re a close-knit community and everybody is working to take care of each other,” she told Reuters by telephone.

The quake is the largest in Southern California since the 1994 magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake, USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso said. That quake, which was centered in a heavily populated area of Los Angeles, killed 57 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.

Ridgecrest may not get much respite in the hours and days ahead.

USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said more than 80 aftershocks had hit the area in the hours since the initial quake. “We should be expecting lots of aftershocks and some of them will be bigger than the 3s we’ve been having so far,” Jones told a news conference.

“I think the chance of having a magnitude 5...is probably greater than 50-50,” she said.

The quake was very shallow, only 6.7 miles (10.7 km), amplifying its effect, and was felt in an area inhabited by 20 million people, the European quake agency EMSC said.

The quake was very shallow, only 6.7 miles (10.7 km), amplifying its effect, and was felt in an area inhabited by 20 million people, the European quake agency EMSC said.

Chuck Schlie, who was visiting Los Angeles for the first time with his family from St. Louis, said he was lying in bed at his hotel room in nearby Anaheim when he felt rumbling.

“I thought, wow, this is really weird. Am I going crazy?” Schlie said outside the historic TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. “If you’ve never experienced it, you think, ‘Am I out of my mind? Why am I feeling like this?’”

James Wilhorn, the manager of Howard’s Mini Mart in Ridgecrest, said his gas station was the only one open in the area because of damage to others and the Independence Day holiday, and there was a line of 20 cars waiting to fill their tanks.

“I mopped up over 20 gallons (76 liters) of wine that fell over in addition to the beer, soda and the cooler that fell over. We have several thousand dollars worth of damage,” Wilhorn said.

Some 5,851 customers were without power in Kern County, according to poweroutage.us.

Beijing’s Message to Hong Kong: Get in Line or Face Irrelevance

After a week of turbulence in Hong Kong, Beijing appears to have settled on its message to the city: continued protests risk throwing away everything that makes it special.

A front-page editorial in the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, the People’s Daily, blasted the protesters who stormed the city’s legislative chamber on Monday as “extremists” whose actions threaten to hinder economic and social development and “ruin Hong Kong’s reputation as an international business metropolis.”

The comments play into widespread anxiety fomenting among Hong Kong residents: that the former British colony risks irrelevance as it is slowly swallowed up by an increasingly wealthy and powerful China. Beijing is using the week’s violence to put its own spin on events, sending protesters the message that their actions are more likely to speed up that trend than to slow it down. State media has presented Hong Kong as a city on the brink.

“As the global economic landscape undergoes profound adjustments and international competition becomes increasingly fierce, Hong Kong faces great challenges and cannot afford flux or internal attrition,” the People’s Daily said.

Historic protests erupted in the city last month over Lam’s decision to push ahead with a controversial bill that would ease extraditions to the mainland, alarming locals and spooking Hong Kong’s business community. The ransacking of the legislature came on the anniversary of the 1997 handover, as tens of thousands of people marched peacefully in a separate annual protest that passed near the complex.

“The protesters now risk losing the moral high ground. This could be a turning point,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization. “The violence could destroy their credibility, and it will be hard for anyone in the West to defend. They will also alienate people who supported the movement.”

Party Narrative

State broadcaster CCTV on Tuesday aired footage of Chief Executive Carrie Lam denouncing the demonstrators and footage of police riding in to secure the building. A website run by the Communist Party’s nationalist Global Times said the chaos “disrupted public order and challenges the rule of law.”

It’s a narrative that directly challenges some of China’s external critics. “What I would say to President Xi is, ‘look at how special Hong Kong is,’” U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Monday. “Let it be, it says so much for China if it’s prepared to let Hong Kong operate under a different system with those basic democratic freedoms.”

The tougher line in official media has come together with a more combative stance from the government in Beijing. Both the foreign ministry and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office have denounced the protesters who stormed the legislature as “extremists.”

Unrest Returns to Hong Kong: A Day In Pictures

Officials have also slammed foreign critics of the city’s official response. On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang described Western criticisms as “an ugly act of hypocrisy” while warning countries to choose their words and actions carefully. From the outset of the protests, Beijing has obliquely hinted at the role of “foreign interference” in instigating unrest.

In the long run “it is hard to see a happy ending to this impasse,” Simon Pritchard, Global Research Director at Gavekal, wrote in a note.

“On the Hong Kong side, the student holidays will end and the pragmatism that characterizes most of the population may persuade all but a hard core of protesters to back away,” he said. “If something like this does play out, it will be a fragile truce until the next big challenge to Hong Kong’s way of life comes around.”

How Poland became a front in the cold war between the U.S. and China

An alleged spying case involves a Chinese businessman who speaks Polish and worked for Huawei – the Chinese telecom-gear giant in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. In lengthy remarks, the jailed Chinese suspect tells Reuters he’s an innocent casualty of the campaign against Huawei.

On a frigid morning in January, Polish internal security officers entered the Warsaw apartment of a foreign businessman, confiscated photographs, seized his electronic devices and detained him. The allegations levelled against him were sensational: An ex-diplomat who speaks Polish, he and a former Polish security official had spied on behalf of a foreign power.

The drama had elements of a classic Cold War thriller, updated for the 21st century. The predatory power was not America - Washington and Warsaw are now allies - nor Russia, Poland’s Soviet-era master. It was China. The businessman was Chinese, a salesman for the world’s largest maker of telecom networking gear, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. And the alleged Polish traitor, detained the same day, wasn’t a soldier but a senior cybersecurity specialist.

The arrests opened another front in America’s new Cold War, with China. It is a struggle in which Huawei figures prominently, as Washington wages a global campaign to dissuade allies from using the company’s equipment in the next generation of mobile-phone technology, known as 5G. The Trump administration in May effectively banned the use of Huawei gear in U.S. telecom networks and restricted the company’s purchases of American technology. Washington says the company is an arm of the Chinese government, and U.S. officials fear Huawei’s 5G technology could be exploited for espionage and sabotaging a country’s critical infrastructure. Huawei denies this.

At the G20 summit in Japan last week, Trump said U.S. companies would be allowed to sell some components to Huawei. But he didn’t reverse the de facto ban on using Huawei gear in U.S. networks.

Since announcing the arrests, Polish prosecutors have said little about the case; it is mostly classified. But in lengthy responses from jail to questions from Reuters, the Chinese businessman at the center of the case, Wang Weijing, said he was innocent.   

“I am wrongfully accused for doing things I have never done and am being kept away from my family,” he said. “Not to mention that finding an alleged spy in Huawei is a perfect excuse to kick Huawei out of Poland and elsewhere.”

Wang’s responses, delivered by his lawyer, Bartlomiej Jankowski, provide new details about the case and about his relationship with the other defendant, Piotr Durbajlo. Among them: Wang says that Durbajlo was probably his best Polish friend; the two men spent time in China together on three occasions, including during a 2013 visit by Polish government officials to Huawei’s headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen and a 10-day vacation last summer; and Huawei, which fired Wang after his arrest, has nevertheless provided him some support.

Reuters has also learned that Poland’s security services are interested in Durbajlo’s travel to China. And they are looking into his work on a project at a Warsaw military university that involved creating a monitoring system to guard against intruders accessing classified information sent through fiber optic communication networks.    

The Huawei battle reflects a fundamental geostrategic shift in Washington. For decades, the U.S. foreign policy establishment assumed Beijing would evolve into a cooperative partner in the rules-based, American-led international order that did so much to foster China's boom. That hope has evaporated. Now, the United States sees China as an adversary determined to challenge American leadership in technology and innovation. President Donald Trump has launched a trade war against Beijing and is boosting defense spending. Huawei is cast as a Chinese standard-bearer in that struggle.

But this counter-strategy is creating new tensions in the Western alliance. Many U.S. allies face a hard choice: block Huawei, remain in America’s good graces and alienate China; or opt to use Huawei’s cheaper equipment in their 5G networks and risk Washington’s wrath.

Government officials in Poland, which relies on U.S. security backing in the face of an emboldened Russia, have told Reuters that Wang’s arrest was a further reason to rethink the integral role Huawei plays in Poland’s telecom networks. Poland has yet to decide whether to impose restrictions on Huawei.

“The danger of using equipment from Chinese companies like Huawei is very real, as recent events in Poland prove,” U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher told Reuters, pointing to “the need for all our European allies to take this threat seriously” in building telecom networks.

Huawei declined to answer questions for this story. “As the Poland case remains subject to a legal case, we are unable to provide any comment at this time,” a company spokesman said.

Given his resume, Wang Weijing says he can understand why Polish authorities might believe he is a spy for China. Besides the fact he speaks Polish and worked at Huawei, he had a four-and-a-half-year stint at the Chinese consulate in the port city of Gdansk and cultivated relations with Polish officials during his time in the country.

“I guess I could be considered as a potentially good candidate to become a spy,” the 37-year-old Chinese national told Reuters from inside Warszawa-Bialoleka prison and detention center.

But Wang flatly denies spying for Beijing: “No one ever offered me such a job,” he told Reuters.

“I have never spied for the Chinese government. I have never done anything to the detriment of Poland. That would be absurd,” he also said. “Poland is my second home.”

Wang’s lawyer Jankowski, who declined to discuss any of the evidence in the case, believes his client has become collateral damage in America’s war on Huawei. He’s concerned, he says, that his client might remain in jail for at least two years before he’s either freed or indicted. Under Polish law, a suspect can be held in detention for years while authorities continue to investigate.

Whatever Wang’s ultimate fate, his case is now embroiled in America’s war on Huawei.

The United States has praised Poland for the arrests of Wang and Durbajlo. During a visit to Warsaw in February, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Washington “welcomes Poland’s partnership as we work to protect the telecommunications sector from China.” The detention of “a Huawei executive and a Polish national accused of cooperating with him,” Pence added, “demonstrate your government’s commitment to ensure our telecommunications sector is not compromised in a way that threatens our national security.”

China’s Foreign Ministry directed Reuters to comments it made on the case in January. “We noted that both the relevant Polish side and Huawei have said in their statements that the case of Wang Weijing is entirely an individual one,” a spokeswoman said at the time. Attempts to “crack down” on Chinese technology companies, she added, were being driven by baseless charges. “Huawei’s reputation for security has been praised by its partners for many years,” she said.

According to Huawei, the company has more than 900 employees in Poland and so far has invested more than $1.3 billion in the country. Poland’s biggest mobile operator, Play Communications SA, says it has built the vast majority of its network’s base stations using Huawei equipment.

Days after Polish security personnel detained Wang on Jan. 8, Huawei fired him, stating that the incident had brought the company “into disrepute” and that Wang’s “alleged actions have no relation to the company.” Yet Wang told Reuters that company employees have been helping his wife on a “daily basis” and that Huawei has provided his lawyer with some documents related to his work “to assist the investigation.” He didn’t elaborate. He also said he hopes the company will help pay his legal expenses.

A lawyer for Durbajlo said he didn’t want his client to comment for this story. “We filed a request to overturn the arrest and it was not accepted,” the lawyer said. Wang’s wife declined through a friend to be interviewed.

This article is based on interviews with more than 20 people who knew either Wang or Durbajlo or have knowledge of the case. They include former colleagues and friends, business associates, government officials and former intelligence agents.

The interviews showed that both had extensive contacts in Poland’s government and telecom industry, had known each other for years and had grown very close.

Polish President Andrzej Duda told Reuters that the allegations were not “empty,” that “documentation exists” and that the arrests of the two men on espionage charges mean “there is evidence that such activities may have been carried out.”

“So as far as I understand, in this respect, from the point of view of the [Polish security] services and prosecutor’s office, the case is unequivocal,” said Duda, who spoke in an interview last month.

Polish dictionaries

Wang’s arrest was a stunning twist in a journey to Poland that began nearly two decades ago.

Wang, who also goes by the Polish first name Stanislaw, said he grew up in a village that is now part of the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang. He became one of the first students in his village to be accepted at a university, after scoring well on an exam, he said. That earned him the chance to study Polish at the prestigious Beijing Foreign Studies University.

“Frankly speaking, I really had very poor knowledge about Poland at that time,” Wang said. “I discussed it with my parents and we decided that studying Polish at the best university of foreign languages in China would be a good investment in my future.”

At university, Wang was diligent and often visited the library, said a friend who has known him for years. The school had seven Polish dictionaries for students, of which four could be borrowed. “You would see his name in all four dictionaries,” the friend said.

Wang’s hard work paid off. He was one of four students at the university who won a scholarship to go to Poland to study the language in the central city of Lodz, he said. He arrived in the fall of 2001 and studied there for about 10 months. “That was the very beginning of my contact with Poland,” he said.

He returned to China and later held jobs distributing wine and trading amber jewelry, he said. In 2006, he learned that China’s consulate in the northern Polish port city of Gdansk was seeking a Polish-Chinese translator. He passed a Polish language exam and was hired.

Wang said he worked at the consulate for four-and-a-half years and was one of only three Chinese employees, and the only one who spoke Polish. His official title, he said, was cultural attaché. But he handled protocol, administrative and visa issues, as well as some menial tasks. “I used to remove snow and wash cars,” he said.

He said he also frequently assisted the consulate’s top diplomat. “I travelled across northern Poland on numerous occasions and participated in numerous meetings with local authorities, together with the Consul General,” he said.

The Chinese consulate didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Wang left the consulate in January 2011 and returned to China, seeking new challenges. About two months later, Huawei contacted him about a public relations job with the company in Poland. “I guess they got my contact via my colleagues” - either from the Beijing university he attended or the Chinese embassy, he said.

Wang landed the job and returned to Poland in June 2011. At Huawei, Wang was responsible for handling public affairs as the company worked to expand beyond selling equipment to telecom operators and enter new markets for its technology.

His job, he said, included networking with Polish government officials, institutions and industry groups, as well as “maintaining good working relationships with China-related institutions.” He said he also kept in regular contact with the Chinese embassy.

By 2017, Wang had changed jobs to become a salesman in Huawei’s Enterprise Business Group, where he worked targeting Poland’s public sector. He said he was mainly seeking sales opportunities in government ministries and institutions, and state-owned companies. They included the railways and a national research institute tasked with internet security and responding to cybersecurity threats.

Wang said he had contacts in the Polish government and telecommunications industry. But he said he was only doing his job. “Not knowing the key people on the market would be an act of negligence,” he said.

“I guess I could be considered as a potentially good candidate to become a spy. Nevertheless, no one ever offered me such a job.”

People who interacted with Wang said he was an assiduous networker. He was a regular at events hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw, according to a Chinese business executive. Several people recounted receiving text greetings, or little presents of Chinese tea or calendars from him during Chinese and Polish holidays. Wang’s command of Polish set him apart from his Chinese colleagues, said a former Polish government official.

Wang told Reuters he wasn’t directly involved in Huawei’s 5G business. But he said he understands why Huawei quickly fired him. “When an employee is criminally accused as ‘a spy,’ what do you think the company could do?” he said. “The company did what it had to do and I understand that.”

Russia fears

While Polish officials say they are open to increasing trade ties with China, President Duda said he is opposed to investment by Beijing in strategic infrastructure, including seaports and airports. Poland-China relations have also cooled as Warsaw has sought closer ties with Washington in the face of what the Poles see as a growing threat from Russia, analysts say.

In March last year, Poland signed a $4.75 billion deal with Washington to purchase the Patriot missile defense system - the biggest arms procurement deal in Polish history. Currently, there are several thousand American soldiers stationed in Poland on a rotational basis. Last month, President Donald Trump pledged to deploy an additional 1,000 U.S. troops to the country.

China’s Foreign Ministry told Reuters that Beijing “attaches importance to developing relations with Poland and is willing to cooperate with Poland based on mutual respect and trust.”

According to a Polish government official, China’s foreign intelligence services have increased their monitoring of Poland’s economy and politics in an effort to improve the prospects of Chinese businesses by better understanding the local market. “This is something our services have identified and monitored,” the official said.

Now, the espionage case has further strained Poland’s relationship with China. “It has created some impasse in our relations, because we cannot allow for such an activity to be carried out,” Duda said in the interview. “Especially if it concerns such a sensitive element – strategic by nature – as communication technology.”

Wang’s Polish friend Durbajlo, the ex-security agent who is also behind bars, has worked at the top echelons of the Polish government. At times he has worked with people and agencies involved in sensitive national security matters.

A specialist in cybersecurity and telecommunications, Durbajlo is said by friends to be in his late 40s. He has worked over the past two decades in the Polish national police, the Ministry of the Interior and Administration, and the Internal Security Agency (ISA), Poland’s domestic intelligence service, according to a LinkedIn profile in Durbajlo’s name. Reuters has independently confirmed that Durbajlo held most of the positions listed on the profile page.

In 2009, he joined the ISA, where he dealt with telecommunications and cybersecurity and advised the agency’s then-head, Krzysztof Bondaryk, according to a security expert who worked with Durbajlo and Polish media reports. The LinkedIn profile says Durbajlo worked at the ISA for more than four years. There, he had a rare public-facing role. While most agency personnel generally avoid the spotlight, he gave television interviews about cybersecurity, including a 2010 appearance on Polish broadcaster TVN in which he described China as “the leader in hacking.”

Magdalena Gaj, a former senior government telecommunications official, said she attended a training session given by Durbajlo on how to communicate securely. Gaj said Durbajlo later worked as her aide.

In a statement, Poland’s telecom regulatory agency said the ISA assigned Durbajlo to work with the agency beginning in May 2012. He spent the first two years as an advisor to Gaj, then the agency’s president. Durbajlo left in 2016.

Gaj said she and Durbajlo had become friends. “I worked with this man for several years and he gave me the impression of being a really big patriot,” she said.

The ISA declined to comment for this story.

At the Military University of Technology, Durbajlo worked on a particularly sensitive matter - a project to protect fiber optic networks from intruders accessing classified information that ran between 2012 and 2015. Since the arrests, security officials have interviewed at least two people with knowledge of that work, Reuters has learned. The university declined to comment on Durbajlo’s role there.

In 2016, Durbajlo worked in the office of Poland’s telecommunications regulator and was involved with a group of experts that handled security for Pope Francis' five-day visit to Poland that year, according to Polish media reports. The next year, Durbajlo retired from the ISA. In October 2017, he became a consultant to Orange Polska, Poland’s largest telecom operator, which is controlled by French telecom group Orange. Durbajlo ended his work with Orange after his arrest, the company told Reuters.

Blossoming friendship

Wang told Reuters he doesn’t “entirely recall” when he first met Durbajlo or learned that Durbajlo had worked in intelligence. But he said Durbajlo was part of a Polish government delegation that visited Huawei’s Shenzhen headquarters in 2013. Gaj, who at the time was president of Poland’s telecommunications regulatory agency, said she brought Durbajlo along in part to give her “counterintelligence” protection, given his experience at the ISA. Wang said he met the delegation during the visit.

Wang’s initial interactions with Durbajlo were all business, Wang said, involving such matters as cybersecurity. Huawei, he added, also invited Durbajlo, as a representative of Poland’s telecom regulator, to attend a broadband conference in Hong Kong, which he did. Durbajlo was part of a delegation from Poland that attended the 2015 conference and also visited Huawei’s headquarters in Shenzhen, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In time, Wang said he and Durbajlo grew close. “In 2016, prior to my son being born, I was seeking advice from my Polish friends regarding recommended hospitals and Piotr helped me to find some really good doctors,” Wang said. “He has always offered his kind help and warm advice.”

Wang said the two men visited each other’s homes, and he helped Durbajlo plan a family trip to China last year. “I took my vacation and accompanied them on their trip while my wife remained at home with our son,” he said.

He even recommended Durbajlo for a job at Huawei. “It didn’t work out,” Wang said.

Wang said he hasn’t seen Durbajlo in jail and doesn’t know his friend’s role in “this game.”

The former Huawei employee, though, isn’t surprised that the company was targeted. By the end of 2018, he said, he anticipated that Poland would follow America’s lead and “take some action against Huawei.” But, he added, he didn’t expect it would be “directed against a single person.”

Chinese border guards put secret surveillance app on tourists' phones

Software extracts emails, texts and contacts and could be used to track movements

Chinese border police are secretly installing surveillance apps on the phones of visitors and downloading personal information as part of the government’s intensive scrutiny of the remote Xinjiang region, the Guardian can reveal.

The Chinese government has curbed freedoms in the province for the local Muslim population, installing facial recognition cameras on streets and in mosques and reportedly forcing residents to download software that searches their phones.

An investigation by the Guardian and international partners has found that travellers are being targeted when they attempt to enter the region from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.

Border guards are taking their phones and secretly installing an app that extracts emails, texts and contacts, as well as information about the handset itself.

Tourists say they have not been warned by authorities in advance or told about what the software is looking for, or that their information is being taken.

The investigation, with partners including Süddeutsche Zeitung and the New York Times, has found that people using the remote Irkeshtam border crossing into the country are routinely having their phones screened by guards.

Edin Omanović, of the campaign group Privacy International, described the findings as “highly alarming in a country where downloading the wrong app or news article could land you in a detention camp”.

Analysis by the Guardian, academics and cybersecurity experts suggests the app, designed by a Chinese company,searches Android phones against a huge list of content that the authorities view as problematic.

This includes a variety of terms associated with Islamist extremism, including Inspire, the English-language magazine produced by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and various weapons operation manuals.

However, the surveillance app also searches for information on a range of other material – from fasting during Ramadan to literature by the Dalai Lama, and music by a Japanese metal band called Unholy Grave.

Another file on the list is a self-help manual by the American writer Robert Greene called The 33 Strategies of War.

About 100 million people visit the Xinjiang region every year, according to Chinese authorities. These include domestic and foreign tourists, and most enter from elsewhere in the country.

The Irkeshtam crossing is China’s most westerly border and is used by traders and tourists, some following the historic Silk Road.

There are several stages to crossing, and at one travellers are made to unlock and hand over their phones and other devices such as cameras. The devices are then taken away to a separate room and returned some time later.

The iPhones are plugged into a reader that scans them, while Android phones have the app installed to do the same job.

It seems that in most cases the app is uninstalled before the phone is returned, but some travellers have found it still on their phone.

It is unclear where all extracted information goes and for how long it is stored.

While there is no evidence that the data is used to track people later in their journeys, the information it collects would allow the authorities to locate someone if used together with details of the phone’s location.

It appears with the default Android icon and the words 蜂采 (Fēng cǎi); the term has no direct English translation, but relates to bees collecting honey.

The Guardian spoke to a traveller who had crossed the border to Xinjiang this year with an Android phone and was disturbed to see the app installed on his phone.

He said he had been asked to hand over his phone at the checkpoint, and it had been taken into a separate room. He and all the other travellers at that checkpoint had also been asked to hand their pin numbers to the officials, and had waited about an hour to have their phones returned.

At no point were they told what was being done to the phones.

He had been told by an international travel agent and by tourist information in Kyrgyzstan that something would happen with his phone at the border.

“We thought it was a GPS tracker,” he said. “[The travel company] was pretty sure we were going to have this thing put in.”

He checked his phone when it was handed back and found the app immediately.

“There was another checkpoint about two hours away and I was thinking that maybe they had downloaded things and they would have all of their analysts going through it all while we were travelling, and then maybe they [would] send people back when they got to the next place.”

The traveller said he had not been asked to hand over the phone at any other point during his visit, nor when he departed from China. He said he had not been concerned about carrying the phone with him, as there was so much overt surveillance in the region. He added: “I don’t like it. If they were doing it in my home country I would be aghast, but when you are travelling to China you know it might be like this.”

All of the installations confirmed by the Guardian and its partners were on Android phones, but travellers report that iPhones were also taken by officers.

Omanovic said: “This is yet another example of why the surveillance regime in Xinjiang is one of the most unlawful, pervasive and draconian in the world.

“Modern extraction systems take advantage of this to build a detailed but flawed picture into people’s lives. Modern apps, platforms and devices generate huge amounts of data which people likely aren’t even aware of or believe they have deleted, but which can still be found on the device.”

Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “We already know that Xinjiang residents, particularly Turkic Muslims–, are subjected to round-the-clock and multidimensional surveillance in the region.

“What you have found goes beyond that. It suggests that even foreigners are subjected to such mass and unlawful surveillance.”

The use of the app came to light after travellers took their phone to reporters in Germany.

Analysis of that software by the Guardian, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Ruhr-University Bochum and the German cybersecurity firm Cure53 suggested it was designed to upload information such as emails on to a server at the border office.

The Chinese authorities were contacted for comment but there was no reply by the time of publication.

Previously the Chinese government has defended its hi-tech surveillance of citizens in Xinjiang, saying it has improved security in the region.

任何曾遭霉菌感染的人都知道真菌非常难杀死。事实证明，霉菌对于外太空的恶劣条件也要有非常高的抗性。研究人员在天体生物科学会议上报告称，霉菌的孢子能够在200倍于人类致死剂量下存活。这样的抗性使得很难消除霉菌对宇航员的健康威胁。霉菌有一天可能会通过从地球上搭便车的孢子威胁到太阳系的其他部分。<br>国际空间站上的宇航员一直在和长在空间站内墙上和设备上的霉菌持续斗争。这些霉菌是长在低地球轨道的保护结构下的，那里的辐射剂量相对低一些。空间站外辐射剂量会更高，前往火星途中航天器外壳处的辐射剂量会更高。<br>为了找出霉菌在那里可能发生的变化，科隆德国航空航天中心的微生物学家Marta及其同事往一种名为Aspergillus niger的普通黑霉菌中发射辐射和重离子，该种黑色霉菌在空间站中很多。研究者发射了超高剂量的辐射，远多于火星上的宇宙飞船(0.6戈瑞)或火星表面的辐射剂量(0.2戈瑞)。戈瑞是一种测量吸收辐射能量的单位。<br>研究人员发现，孢子可以承受500-1000戈瑞的辐射剂量，具体剂量取决于所接触的辐射种类。相比之下，人类在0.5戈瑞剂量下会得放射性疾病，并在5戈瑞的剂量下被杀死。Marta发现孢子可以在大量高能紫外线辐射下存活，这种紫外线通常被用做医院的消毒剂，并已被提议用做飞船表面的消毒。<br>Marta提醒说她的研究仅讨论了辐射情形，没有涵盖所有的太空极端因素。但是她说根据至少一项更早的研究，孢子在真空中更能抵抗辐射。与此同时，有一件事是肯定的，她说：“我们必然会带着孢子进行太空旅行。真菌已经被遗忘了，但现在是时候提起重视了。”<br>佛罗里达大学北梅里特岛的微生物学家和火星天体生物学家Andrew Schuerger对此表示赞同。他说，到目前为止，大家防止地球上的微生物不会污染其他世界主要是从细菌的角度出发，因为太空船表面的大量微生物都是细菌。“我非常喜欢这样的报告，我们不要忘了另一组叫做真菌的微生物。”<br>拉斯克鲁塞斯新墨西哥州立大学的天体生物学家保罗梅森说，这一发现对研究生命起源的研究人员也很重要。这是因为生命起源研究中的一个难题是，地球似乎在其历史早期从益生元一直变成了相当复杂的微生物。科学家认为这一演化过程时间超过地球变成宜居环境以来的时间。梅森说，一个想法是，生活起源于其他地方，在太阳系或是更远的地方。“现在我们知道地球生命可以在太空中生存，因此认为它可以从其他地方到达地球当然是合理的。”</p>

Space station mold survives 200 times the radiation dose that would kill a human

As anyone who’s ever had a mold infestation knows, the fungi can be very hard to kill. It turns out mold may also be highly resistant to the harsh conditions of outer space. Its spores can survive doses of radiation 200 times higher than those that would kill a human, researchers reported here today at the Astrobiology Science Conference. Such hardiness could make it difficult to eliminate mold's health risks to astronauts. Mold might also one day threaten other parts of the solar system—with hitchhiking mold spores from Earth.

Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) already constantly battle with mold, which grows on the station’s walls and equipment. That mold, of course, is in a protected structure in low-Earth orbit, where radiation doses are low. Outside of the station, doses are higher—and they would be higher still on the hull of a spacecraft going to Mars or beyond.

To find out what might happen to mold there, Marta Cortesão, a microbiologist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne and colleagues beamed x-rays and heavy ions at a common black mold called Aspergillus niger, which is plentiful in the ISS. The researchers fired “stupid amounts” of radiation, Cortesão says—much more than encountered on a Mars-bound spaceship (0.6 gray per year) or on the surface of Mars (0.2 gray per year). The gray is a measure of the amount of absorbed radiation energy.

The researchers discovered that the spores could survive radiation doses of 500 to 1000 gray, depending on which type of radiation they were exposed to. Humans, by contrast, get radiation sickness at doses of 0.5 gray and are killed by 5 gray. Cortesão also found that the spores survived large amounts of high-energy ultraviolet radiation, which is commonly used as a hospital disinfectant and has been proposed for sterilizing the surfaces of spacecraft.

Cortesão cautions that her research focused only on radiation and did not include all aspects of the harsh outer space environment. But, she says, at least one older study suggests that mold spores resist radiation even better in a vacuum. Meanwhile, one thing is certain, she says: “We will have spores with us for sure in our space travels. Fungi have been forgotten for the past 20 or 30 years, but it’s time to go back to them.”

Andrew Schuerger, a microbiologist and Mars astrobiologist at the University of Florida in North Merritt Island, agrees. Most of the focus on keeping Earth’s microorganisms from contaminating other worlds so far has been on bacteria, he says, because the vast bulk of microorganisms on the surfaces of spacecraft has been bacterial. “I really like a presentation like this [that says] ‘Let’s not forget about this other group of microorganisms called fungi,’” he says.

The finding is also important for researchers studying the origin of life, says Paul Mason, an astrobiologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.

That’s because one of the puzzles in origin-of-life research is that Earth seems to have gone from prebiotic all the way to fairly complex microorganisms early in its history—a process that some scientists think required more time than had passed since the planet first became habitable. One idea, Mason says, is that life originated elsewhere, either in our solar system or farther afield. “Now that we know that Earth life can survive in space, it is certainly reasonable to think that it could have arrived on Earth from somewhere else,” he says.

Hong Kong police fire teargas and charge at protesters

Officers move to disperse crowds after breakaway group stormed parliament building

Hong Kong police have fired teargas at demonstrators and moved to disperse crowds after protesters stormed the legislative council building and raised the territory’s former colonial flag on the 22nd anniversary of its handover to China.

The dramatic scenes came after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city as its deepest political crisis in two decades showed no sign of abating. For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.

The police action came against a breakaway group of protesters, some of whom had forced their way into the legislative council building and vandalised its main chamber.

Shortly after midnight local time (1600 BST), police in riot gear held up a black flag reading “teargas warning” before shooting several rounds of the gas into protesters. They then climbed over barricades put up by protesters earlier in the day and charged at the people gathered.

Outside the legislative council building protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and masks ran away clutching umbrellas as smoke filled the air.

Protesters had for hours been repeatedly striking reinforced glass walls with a metal trolley and poles as hundreds of others watched on. Once inside they threw chairs and tore down and defaced portraits of past lawmakers. After the protesters were dispersed, images of the vandalised building were broadcast. More than 50 people were reportedly taken to hospital for treatment after various protests throughout the day.

“I don’t know whether this would work, but what other channels are there to make Carrie Lam listen to us?” said a male protester outside the legislative council building, who declined to be named.

“We used to protest peacefully but it didn’t work, now we need to get out of this framework and tell them, we’re willing to try anything until you give us an answer.”

Police had issued several warnings through the evening and appeared to be gearing up for violent clashes, but had left the protesters largely unhindered in their efforts even as the group tore up the inside of the building. Local TV footage showed police officers armed with non-lethal weaponry in other parts of the government complex as the protesters broke in.

One lawmaker, Fernando Cheung, suggested to reporters that the inaction from police had been a trap, aimed at swinging public sentiment against the protest movement with the help of violent and destructive scenes.

Half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers had earlier scuffled with protesters as they called for calm and pushed against the trolley that was being used to enter the council building.

“They simply wouldn’t listen to me,” said Lam Cheuk-ting, one of the politicians. “The movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they’re emotionally charged.”

While a small splinter group was causing trouble at the legislature, 550,000 people marched peacefully through downtown Hong Kong without any scenes of violence or chaos.

The organisers of that rally – the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) – issued a joint statement with democratic lawmakers placing the blame for the destruction at the legislative council squarely on Lam, saying she had “ignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation”.

The CHRF also reiterated its five demands: the full retraction of the controversial extradition law amendment bill; an investigation into police brutality; Lam’s resignation; the release of arrested protesters; and the removal of the designation of the earlier clashes as a riot.

A joint statement from 41 pro-government lawmakers condemned what they described as “extremely radical and violent acts”, such as the occupying of roads and damaging the council building.

The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.

Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents believe Beijing is reneging on that deal.

While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam’s attempts to pass the proposed extradition legislation, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against her administration and Beijing.

Both the protesters and the government have in recent weeks been trying to keep public opinion and attention on their side. The protesters have mostly been orderly, obeying traffic laws, cleaning up after themselves and allowing ambulances to pass even when tens of thousands are gathered.

They even returned to bow and apologise to civil servants after a small-scale protest forced government offices to shut and the staff to go home early.

Up until midnight police were far more restrained with their use of force, having been criticised for their actions against protesters at a smaller protest on 12 June, when they fired 150 rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, and videos of police beating and pepper-spraying unarmed protesters circulated over the internet.

The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Monday stressed “UK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms”, saying in a statement that “no violence is acceptable but Hong Kong people must preserve the right to peaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showed today.”

UK diplomats will be concerned that the Hong Kong executive might use the violence as a reason to impose severe penalties on protesters, including possibly reintroducing the suspended extradition law. The UK had been privately pressing for the legislation to be dropped altogether.

China also reiterated its stance against what it called “foreign interference” in Hong Kong. Speaking in Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said the UK’s rights and obligations under the joint declaration on the 1997 handover of Hong Kong had ended.

“Britain has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair for China. No foreign country has a right to interfere,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

“Recently Britain has continuously gesticulated about Hong Kong, flagrantly interfering. We are extremely dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposed.”

Earlier in the day, Lam attempted to calm the mood during an official ceremony at a convention centre in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district to mark the 22nd anniversary of the handover.

In her speech, Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise “the need to grasp public sentiments accurately”. She said: “I am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.”

Hong Kong protesters storm legislature, smash doors and walls

Demonstrators rip portraits of chief executives from walls and spray graffiti as hundreds of riot police converge.

Hundreds of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and surrounded the legislature after protesters smashed their way in and occupied the building in unprecedented scenes. 

Police restored control early Tuesday after clashes with protesters on the streets of Hong Kong at the end of a day of unrest.

Demonstrators in their hundreds overran in the Chinese territory's legislature late on Monday, smashing walls, spray-painting graffiti, and taking over the chamber as the weeks-long crisis over a controversial extradition bill came to a head. 

Police carrying riot shields, batons, and firing tear gas moved in shortly after midnight to clear surrounding streets. Plumes of smoke billowed across major thoroughfares and in between some of the world's tallest skyscrapers.

The authorities earlier warned demonstrators to clear the building immediately, calling the occupation "illegal" and saying they would deploy "appropriate force" if the protesters remained inside. 

The extraordinary scenes came on the anniversary of the semi-autonomous territory's return from British control to mainland China 22 years ago.

Riot police apparently retreated as hundreds of demonstrators streamed into the building after a small group of mostly students wearing hard hats and masks used a metal trolley, poles and scaffolding to repeatedly charge at the compound's reinforced glass doors, which finally gave way. 

Once inside, protesters ripped portraits of officials from walls and spray painted slogans calling for the release of arrested demonstrators. An old colonial-era flag was draped over the speaker's chair and a plaque showing a white flower, the symbol of Hong Kong, was blacked-out with spray paint.

The flag was later replaced by a black sign that read: "There is no way left. There's no rioters, there's only tyranny." 

Some effort was made to safeguard a number of precious objects, however, with protesters placing items on shelves next to signs saying: "Don't break these". 

Peaceful march
Police estimated 190,000 people joined a peaceful march throughout the city on Monday, the third major one in as many weeks. Protest leaders told Al Jazeera about 550,000 people had taken part part in the annual July 1 march, dwarfing previous rallies.

A protester in his early 20s, who gave his name as M, told Al Jazeera from inside the legislative chamber that many planned to remain in the building overnight and their storming of the building was "inevitable" as authorities had ignored previous peaceful protests. 

Andrew K P Leung, an independent political analyst, said police so far had shown "uncharacteristic restraint" after being criticised for using excessive force at previous protests.

"They were extremely patient by allowing the kind of violence and riotous acts to play out to the fullest extent for all to see, but I think police will now have to exercise force to maintain law and order," Leung told Al Jazeera.

Danger point

Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said the actions of protesters were "not helping their cause" and Hong Kong was "getting to a point of danger". 

"If they keep on with the way they are doing it [protesting], then the risk of the Chinese government taking much more drastic action gets that much closer," he told Al Jazeera.

"It is not in the interest of Hong Kong to force a situation where Beijing feels it has to take direct actions to intervene". 

Tsang added while the majority in Hong Kong supported the removal of the extradition bill, the actions of protesters threatened to divide the territory's pro-democracy movement.

Al Jazeera's Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said Chinese authorities had so far been silent on Monday's protests and state television channel CGTN was broadcasting footage of celebrations in Hong Kong to mark the July 1 anniversary, rather than scenes of the occupation. 

Weeks of protests
Protests first began last month over an extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam suspended the controversial bill on June 18 after some of the largest and most violent demonstrations in the city in decades - with millions attending - but she stopped short of protesters' demands to scrap it entirely. 

The Beijing-backed leader is now clinging to her job as protesters call for her resignation at a time of unprecedented backlash against the government, which poses the greatest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.

Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" framework that allows the territory freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary.

Opponents of the extradition bill fear it is a threat to Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and would allow Beijing to target opponents.

China warns of long road ahead for deal with U.S. after ice-breaking talks

China and the United States will face a long road before they can reach a deal to end their bitter trade war, with more fights ahead likely, Chinese state media said after the two countries’ presidents held ice-breaking talks in Japan.

The world’s two largest economies are in the midst of a bitter trade war, which has seen them level increasingly severe tariffs on each other’s imports.

In a sign of significant progress in relations on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, agreed to a ceasefire and a return to talks.

However, the official China Daily, an English-language daily often used by Beijing to put its message out to the rest of the world, warned while there was now a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement, there’s no guarantee there would be one.

“Even though Washington agreed to postpone levying additional tariffs on Chinese goods to make way for negotiations, and Trump even hinted at putting off decisions on Huawei until the end of negotiations, things are still very much up in the air,” it said in an editorial late Saturday.

“Agreement on 90 percent of the issues has proved not to be enough, and with the remaining 10 percent where their fundamental differences reside, it is not going to be easy to reach a 100-percent consensus, since at this point, they remain widely apart even on the conceptual level.”

Trump also offered an olive branch to Xi on Huawei Technologies Co, the world’s biggest telecom network equipment maker. The Trump administration has said the Chinese firm poses a national security risk given its close ties to China’s government, and has lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure.

The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, in a lengthy statement about G20 released by the Foreign Ministry following the delegation’s return to Beijing, said the Xi-Trump meeting had sent a “positive signal” to the world.

Though problems between the two countries remain, China is confident as long as they both follow the consensus reached by their leaders they can resolve their problems on the basis of mutual respect, Wang said in the statement released late Saturday.

Trump’s comments on Huawei, made at a more than hour-long news conference in Osaka following his sit-down with Xi, generated only a cautious welcome from China. The word “Huawei” was not mentioned at all in the top diplomat’s appraisal of G20.

Wang Xiaolong, the Foreign Ministry’s special envoy of G20 affairs and head of the ministry’s Department of International Economic Affairs, said if the United States does what it says on Huawei then China would of course welcome it.

“To put restrictions in areas that go beyond technology and economic factors will definitely lead to a lose-lose situation. So if the U.S. side can do what it says then we will certainly welcome that,” Wang told reporters. 

The pause in tensions is likely to be welcomed by the business community, and markets, which have swooned on both sides of the Pacific due to the trade war.

Jacob Parker, vice-president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said returning to talks was good news for the business community and added much needed certainty to “a slowly deteriorating relationship”.

“Now comes the hard work of finding consensus on the most difficult issues in the relationship, but with a commitment from the top we’re hopeful this will put the two sides on a sustained path to resolution.”

China’s position as the trade war has progressed has become increasingly strident, saying it would not be bullied, would not give in to pressure, and that it would “fight to the end”.

Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat account run by China’s Economic Daily, said the United States was now aware that China was not going to give in, and that tariffs on Chinese goods were increasingly unpopular back home.

“We’ve said it before - communication and friction between China and the United States is a long-term, difficult and complex thing. Fighting then talking, fighting then talking, is the normal state of affairs,” it said.

Donald Trump invites Kim Jong-un to US after entering North Korea
US president hails ‘great honour’ of crossing border at impromptu meeting

Donald Trump has invited Kim Jong-un to the US after becoming the first sitting American president to enter North Korea.

The apparently impromptu meeting came about after Trump tweeted an invitation to Kim on Saturday from the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.

After shaking hands with Kim in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas and walking with him over the border, Trump said: “Stepping across that line is a great honour. Great progress has been made, great friendships have been made and this has been, in particular, a great friendship.”

Following a trilateral meeting between Kim, Trump and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, Trump later said he agreed with Kim to restart talks after nuclear negotiations stalled earlier this year and had invited him to the US “when the time is right”.

Trump said he and Kim were “not looking for speed. We’re looking to get it right.” He added: “We are going to have teams, they are going to meet over the next weeks, they are going to start a process and we will see what happens.”

He said sanctions would remain in place, but suggested Washington might be willing to offer concessions in return for piecemeal North Korean moves towards denuclearisation – an approach it had previously rejected. “At some point during the negotiation things can happen,” he said.

Kim said the meeting at the heavily armed border, which was originally supposed to be a brief exchange of pleasantries but lasted almost an hour, was symbolic of warming ties between the US and North Korea.

“I think meeting here, two countries that have a hostile past, we are showcasing to the world that we have a new present and we have a positive meeting going forward,” he said.

The main source of tension appeared to be between US reporters and North Korean security guards.

The jostling seen outside when Kim and Trump met worsened when North Korean guards tried to physically prevent reporters with the US press pool from entering a room inside the Freedom House on the southern side of the DMZ where the two leaders were about to start their meeting. Reports said the Secret Service had to intervene.

Those roughed up in the scuffle included the new White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, who ended up with bruises.

Earlier, in the South Korean capital, Seoul, Trump said he was “looking forward to [the meeting] very much … He understands me and I think I maybe understand him.”

“We have a very good relationship, the two of us,” he added, referring to Kim. “I want to say hello. Let’s see what happens … It will be very short but that’s OK. A handshake means a lot.”

Moon said ahead of the talks that even a handshake and brief encounter between Trump and Kim “would be a significant milestone in the peace process on the Korean peninsula”.

He said he could “really feel that the flower of peace was truly blossoming on the Korean peninsula”.

Moon later told a joint press conference he was “overwhelmed” with emotion about the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom. He described Trump and Kim as “so brave”, adding: “I hope President Trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on the Korean peninsula.”

Trump said at the G20 in Osaka on Saturday that he would have “no problem” stepping into North Korea with Kim. In 2018 Kim had invited Moon to walk over the military demarcation line that forms the border between the Koreas.

Trump is the first sitting US president to step across the border, and the gesture represents a public relations coup for Kim, who has held summits with Trump, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the past year.

Trump and Kim first met in Singapore last year in a blaze of publicity – the first encounter between a leader of nuclear-armed North Korea and a sitting US president. The two countries’ forces and their allies fought each other to a stalemate in the 1950-53 Korean war.

The Singapore summit produced a vaguely worded pledge about denuclearisation, but a second meeting in Hanoi in Vietnam in February broke up abruptly without agreement.

Contact between the two sides has since been minimal, with Pyongyang issuing frequent criticisms of the US position, but the two leaders have exchanged a series of letters.

The 2.5-mile-wide DMZ, which runs for 150 miles, is where the frontline lay when the Korean war ended in 1953, with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty. It is described as the world’s last cold war frontier.

Trump claimed before he crossed the border that both North and South Korea had benefited from his attempts to engage Kim since he became president. “North Korea and South Korea are both in much better places than they were two and a half years ago,” he said. “It’s day and night.”

“Lots of good things are happening with North Korea,” he told South Korean business leaders, repeating his belief that the US “would have been at war with North Korea” if someone else had been elected to the White House.

However, Robert Kelly of South Korea’s Pusan National University derided Trump’s invitation to Kim as “emblematic of why the Trump NK effort is a farce: thrown together; last-minute; made for TV”.

It was driven by Trump’s “lust for optics and drama rather than substance” and “a photo op for the 2020 election”, he tweeted.

But John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul said a meeting in the “barren no man’s land that embodies the unhealed wound of post-WWII division, the Korean war, and 70 years of animosity” would help improve ties.

“It’s not just about denuclearisation and it’s not all about a deal – important as those are,” he said. “If Trump and Kim meet and can announce some kind of interim agreement, that’s great. If they meet and don’t, that’s OK too. If in the end they don’t meet, it’s good that Trump offered to.”

On Sunday morning, Trump also hailed the trade talks with Xi at the G20 in Japan on Saturday as having gone “far better than expected” and vowed to hold off on further tariffs as negotiations with China continued.

“The quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. I am in no hurry, but things look very good!” Trump tweeted on Sunday.

The economic ceasefire halting damaging trade frictions came after the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders of on the sidelines of the G20 summit.

Washington confirmed it would not impose any further tariffs on Beijing’s exports. On Sunday Trump reiterated that China had agreed to buy “large amounts of agricultural products from our great farmers”.

“Importantly, we have opened up negotiations again with China as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one,” he tweeted.

US-China trade talks back on track, says Trump
President says US will not impose further tariffs after meeting with Xi Jinping at G20

Donald Trump has declared US trade negotiations with China to be “right back on track” after a highly anticipated meeting with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka.

Trump said the US would not impose further tariffs in a trade war that other world leaders have warned could threaten the global economy, and added that the world’s two biggest economies would restart negotiations on a trade deal.

The US president told a press conference that he and his Chinese counterpart had had a “great meeting”.

“We will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won’t be adding additional [tariffs] … We’re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they’re going to start doing that almost immediately.”

He had said at the start of the meeting that he was open to a “historic fair trade deal” with China. “We are totally open to it,” he told Xi, who called for “cooperation and dialogue” instead of confrontation.

Trump added: “We want to do some things that will even it up with respect to trade. We were very close but something happened where it slipped up a little bit,” he added, in a reference to the failure of previous talks.

In a G20 declaration issued at the end of the two-day summit, the leaders avoided criticism of Trump-style protectionism but committed themselves to realising “free, fair and non-discriminatory” trade and to “keep our markets open”.

Fears of a protracted trade war that could put other countries, including Japan, in Washington’s crosshairs have overshadowed the summit.

Trump had threatened to extend existing tariffs to cover almost all imports from China to the US unless Beijing made progress in meeting US demands for economic reforms.

Their trade dispute escalated when talks collapsed in May after Washington accused Beijing of reneging on reform pledges. Trump raised tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn of Chinese goods, and China retaliated with levies on US imports.

The Trump-Xi meeting came hours after the European Union and the South American trade bloc, Mercosur, sealed a free trade deal after two decades of negotiations.

The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “In the midst of international trade tensions, we are sending today a strong signal with our Mercosur partners that we stand for rules-based trade.”

Fears that disagreement over the climate crisis could sink the G20 declaration were overcome with a compromise that again left the US isolated in international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

All G20 nations except the US reiterated their determination to implement the Paris agreement, noting in a separate clause that Washington intended to withdraw from the agreement “because it disadvantages American workers and taxpayers”.

The lack of progress on the climate emergency, despite it being flagged as a priority by the summit’s Japanese hosts, drew an angry reaction from campaigners.

Kimiko Hirata, international director of the Kiko Network, said Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had “raised expectations that he would use this G20 moment to take bold action for the planet. Instead, Japan hid behind the Trump administration and didn’t try to build a clear majority of support for climate action and lower ambitions.

“Prime Minister Abe and other G20 leaders need to get serious about their climate commitments and make sure they don’t show up empty-handed for the climate action summit in September.”
